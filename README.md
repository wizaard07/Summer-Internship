- Research and choose datasets for network traffic data.
- Learn about data preprocessing techniques for network traffic data.

### Week 3: Deep Dive into Machine Learning for IDS 🏗️

- Select and research supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms for intrusion detection.
- Design considerations for the IDS detection engine, including real-time processing, scalability, and integration with security systems.
- Identify evaluation metrics and criteria to assess the IDS performance.

### Week 4: Phishing Website Detection and Conclusion 🕵️‍♂️

**Phishing Website Detection**
- Write an introduction on phishing attacks and their use of deceptive URLs.
- Define the objectives and scope of the phishing URL detection project.
- Research data collection methods for phishing and legitimate URLs.
